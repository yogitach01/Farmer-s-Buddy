			+ "Soil is a natural body comprised of solids (minerals and organic matter), liquid, and gases that occurs on the land surface, occupies space, and is characterized by one or both of the following: horizons, or layers, that are distinguishable from the initial material as a result of additions, losses, transfers, and transformations of energy and matter or the ability to support rooted plants in a natural environment.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The lower boundary that separates soil from the non soil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) set up an All India Soil Survey Committee in 1953 which divided the Indian soils into eight major groups. They are:\r\n"
			+ "(1) Alluvial soils\r\n"
			+ "(2) Black soils\r\n"
			+ "(3) Red soils,\r\n"
			+ "(4) Laterite and Lateritic soils\r\n"
			+ "(5) Forest and Mountain soils\r\n"
			+ "(6) Arid and Desert soils\r\n"
			+ "(7) Saline and Alkaline soils\r\n"
			+ "(8) Peaty and Marshy soils\r\n"
			+ "This is a very logical classification of Indian soils and has gained wide acceptance.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "A brief account of Black soils is given as under:\r\n"
			+ "The black soils are also called regur (from the Telugu word Reguda) and black cotton soils because cotton is the most important crop grown on these soils. Several theories have been put forward regarding the origin of this group of soils but most pedologists believe that these soils have been formed due to the solidifaction of lava spread over large areas during volcanic activity in the Deccan Plateau, thousands of years ago.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Most of the black soils are derived from two types of rocks, the Deccan and the Rajmahal trap, and ferruginous gneisses and schists occurring in Tamil Nadu. The former are sufficiently deep while the later are generally shallow.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Krebs holds that the regur is essentially a mature soil which has been produced by relief and climate, rather than by a particular type of rock. According to him, this soil occurs where the annual rainfall is between 50 to 80 cm and the number of rainy days range from 30 to 50. The occurrence of this soil in the west deccan where the rainfall is about 100 cm and the number of rainy days more than 50, is considered by him to be an exception.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "In some parts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, the origin of black cotton soils is ascribed to old lagoons in which the rivers deposited the materials brought down from the interior of Peninsula covered with lava.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Geographically, black soils are spread over 5.46 lakh sq km (i.e. 16.6 per cent of the total geographical area of the country) encompassed between 15Â°N to 25Â°N latitudes and 72Â°E to 82Â°E longitudes. This is the region of high temperature and low rainfall. It is, therefore, a soil group of the dry and hot regions of the Peninsula.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "These soils are mainly found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The black colour of these soils has been attributed by some scientists to the presence of a small proportion of titaniferous magnetite or even to iron and black constituents of the parent rock. The black colour of this soil may even be derived from crystalline schists and basic gneisses such as in Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh. Various tints of the black colour such as deep black, medium black, shallow black or even a mixture of red and black may be found in this group of soils.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The black soil is very retentive of moisture. It swells greatly and becomes sticky when wet in rainy season. Under such conditions, it is almost impossible to work on such soil because the plough gets stuck in the mud.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "However, in the hot dry season, the moisture evaporates, the soil shrinks and is seamed with broad and deep cracks, often 10 to 15 cm wide and upto a meter deep. This permits oxygenation of the soil to sufficient depths and the soil has extraordinary fertility.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Remarkably \"selfÂ¬ploughed\" by loosened particles fallen from the ground into the cracks, the soil \"swallows\" itself and retains soil moisture. This soil has been used for growing a variety of crops for centuries without adding fertilizers and manures, or even fallowing with little or no evidence of exhaustion.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "A typical black soil is highly argillaceous with a large clay factor, 62 per cent or more, without gravel or coarse sand. It also contains 10 per cent of alumina, 9-10 per cent of iron oxide and 6-8 percent of lime and magnesium carbonates. Potash is variable (less than 0.5 per cent) and phosphates, nitrogen and humus are low. The structure is cloddish but occasionally friable.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "In all regur soils in general, and in those derived from ferromagnesian schists in particular, there is a layer rich in kankar nodules formed by segregation of calcium carbonate at lower depths. As a general rule, black soils of uplands are of low fertility but they are darker, deeper and richer in the valleys.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Because of their high fertility and retentivity of moisture, the black soils are widely used for producing several important crops. Some of the major crops grown on the black soils are cotton, wheat, jowar, linseed, Virginia tobacco, castor, sunflower and millets. Rice and sugarcane are equally important where irrigation facilities are available. Large varieties of vegetables and fruits are also successfully grown on the black soils. ";

public String red() {
	String str=" Red soil is a type of soil that develops in a warm, temperate, moist climate under deciduous or mixed forest, having thin organic and organic-mineral layers overlying a yellowish-brown leached layer resting on an illuvium red layer. Red soils are generally derived from crystalline rock. They are usually poor growing soils, low in nutrients and humus and difficult to be cultivated because of its low water holding capacity.The texture of red soil varies from, sand to clay, the majority being loam. Their other characteristics include porous and friable structure, absence of lime, kankar and free carbonates, and small quantity of soluble salts. Their chemical composition include non-soluble material 90.47%, iron 3.61%, aluminium 2.92%, organic matter 1.01%, magnesium 0.70%, lime 0.56%, carbon dioxide 0.30%, potash[clarification needed] 0.24%, soda 0.12%, phosphorus 0.09% and nitrogen 0.08%. However significant regional differences are observed in the chemical composition.\r\n"

On the uplands, they are thin, poor and gravelly, sandy, or stony and porous, light-colored soils on which food crops like bajra can be grown. But on the lower plains and valleys they are rich, deep, dark colored fertile loam on which, under irrigation, they can produce excellent crops like cotton, wheat, pulses, tobacco, jowar, linseed, millet, potatoes and fruits. These are also characterized by stunted forest growth and are suited to dry farming.";

By weight, its mineral composition is about 40–40–20% concentration of sand–silt–clay, respectively.[1] These proportions can vary to a degree, however, and result in different types of loam soils: sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and loam.[1]\r\n"

Loam soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus than sandy soils, have better drainage and infiltration of water and air than silt and clay-rich soils, and are easier to till than clay soils. The different types of loam soils each have slightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently than others. The soil's texture, especially its ability to retain nutrients and water, are crucial.[2] Loam soil is suitable for growing most plant varieties.\r\n"

However, a soil that meets the textural definition of loam can lose its characteristic desirable qualities when it is compacted, depleted of organic matter, or has clay dispersed throughout its fine-earth fraction.[clarification needed]\r\n"

	String str="Sandy soil is easy to spot by its feel. It has a gritty texture and when a handful of sandy soil is squeezed in your hand, it will easily fall apart when you open your hand again. Sandy soil is filled with, well, sand. Sand is primarily small pieces of eroded rocks. Sand tends to have large particles and the particles are solid and have no pockets where water and nutrients can hold to it. Because of this, water and nutrients tend to run out, and because sandy soil lacks both water and nutrients, many plants have a difficult time surviving in this kind of soil.\r\n"
			+ "Cultivation and production\r\n"
			+ "Galanga requires fertile sandy soils and a warm humid climate. It thrives well up to an elevation of about 1500 m above mean sea level. A well-distributed annual rainfall of 1500–3000 mm is required during the growing period and dry spells during land preparation and harvesting.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The species is propagated by rhizome fragments. Mother rhizomes are superior to finger rhizomes. The rhizome bits are planted on beds of 1–2 m width and 25 cm height at a spacing of 40–60 cm2 (IBPGR, 1981; Bhattacharjee, 2000). About 750 kg of seed rhizomes per hectare is required. Planting during the third week of May gives significantly higher rhizome and oil yields.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "The mean nutrient uptake of the crop is 22.8 kg N, 28 kg P2O5 and 36.9 kg K2O per hectare. Application of 50–75 kg N, 60 kg P2O5 and 50–75 kg K2O is found to be beneficial for increased rhizome and oil yields. Application of farmyard manure at 30 tonnes/ha is superior to the application of nutrients through inorganic form of fertilizers and it increased the yield by 60%. A well-managed plantation yields about 4–6 tonnes of fresh rhizomes per hectare. The dry recovery varies from 23 to 28%. Leaf rot disease may occur during the rainy season and can be controlled by trenching the beds with 1% Bordeaux mixture.\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "In Kerala, cultivation of K. galanga is restricted to some localized tracts and the productivity of the crop is low, ranging from 2–5 tonnes of fresh rhizomes per hectare. There is an acute shortage of planting material and the absence of seed set limits the scope for breeding (Kurian et al., 1993).\r\n"
			+ "\r\n"
			+ "Propagation of this crop through tissue culture was reported by Vincent et al. (1992) and Geetha et al. (1997). The tissue cultured plants could not be used directly for field planting as it takes two crop seasons to produce enough rhizomes. However, these plants can be used for planting material production through high-density planting. Propagation by in vitro rhizomes is possible, and is a method that can be commercialized. ";
