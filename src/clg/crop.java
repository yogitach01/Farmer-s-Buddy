				+ "Soil Type: Well-drained fertile loamy and clayey loamy (Ganga-Satluj plains and black soil region of the Deccan)\n"
				+ " Classification of Indian Wheats:\n"
				+ "1. Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccum schub L.) :\n"
				+ "This type was reported to be grown in south i.e. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This type is believed to be developed from T.\n"
				+ " diccoides koru., a wild form. It is also grown in Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia.\n"

				+ " Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy season, followed by three or four \n"
				+ "cultivations and planking immediately before sowing produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. \n"

				+ " Where white ants or other pests are a problem, Aldrin 5% or BHC 10% dust at the rate of 25 kg/ha should be applied to\n"

				+ "Based on above temperature requirement it has been found that for indigenous wheat last \n"
				+ "week of October, for long duration dwarf varieties like Kalyansona, Arjun, etc. \n"
				+ "first fortnight of November and for short duration dwarf wheats like Sonalika, Raj 821 etc. \n"

				+ " like Kalyan Sona, Arjun, Janak, etc.which have moderate tillering and medium sized grains.\n"
				+ " But a higher seed rate of 125 kg/ha is desirable for late sown wheat and normal sown for varieties like Sonalika,\n"
				+ " Raj 821 etc. which have bold grains and shy tillering habits.\n"
				+ "c) Spacing: :"
				+ "For irrigated, timely sown wheat, a row spacing of 15 to 22.5 cm is followed,\n"
				+ " but 22.5 cm between the rows is considered to be the optimum spacing. Under irrigated late-sown conditions,\n"

				+ " Planting beyond this depth results in a poor stand. In the case of conventional tall varieties, the depth of sowing may be 8 or 9 cm.\n"
				+ "d) Seed treatment:"
				+ "The seed of loose smut-susceptible varieties should be given solar or hot-water treatment. \n"
				+ "If the wheat seed is used only for sowing, and not for human consumption or for feeding cattle, it can be treated with Vitavax.\n"

				+ "Method of sowing - Line sowing by seed drill followed as it needs less seeds/ha, weeding and hoeing may be done conveniently\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
				+ "Seed treatment- Seeds are treated with rhizobium culture.\r\n"
				+ "\r\n"
